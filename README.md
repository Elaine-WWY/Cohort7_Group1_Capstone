# iHerb Hair Care Product Analysis

## Background
This project investigates the best-selling hair care products on iHerb, aiming to analyze consumer preferences and market trends through data-driven methods. We utilized web scraping techniques to gather comprehensive product information and customer reviews, focusing on 630 products across various categories.

## Scope
Our analysis encompasses several key components:

- **Web Scraping**: Using tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup, we collected data while overcoming anti-crawler measures implemented by iHerb.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: The scraped data underwent rigorous cleaning and standardization to ensure accuracy and usability.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We employed visualizations to identify trends in sales performance, product distribution, and correlations among different variables.
  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyzed customer sentiments expressed in reviews to gain insights into consumer behavior.

The findings reveal significant trends, such as the dominance of brands like Mielle and SheaMoisture in sales, while highlighting areas for potential growth, particularly for underperforming brands like Dove. This project not only sheds light on current market dynamics but also lays the groundwork for future research into consumer preferences in the hair care industry.

## Language & Tools
The scripts are developed using **Python**, and the data visualization and analysis are conducted with **Power BI**.
